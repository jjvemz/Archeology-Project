   (Semejanzas Culturales Entre Pueblos del Pacífico)

   Content:
   - Stone architecture with megalithic characteristics present throughout Polynesia
   - Evidence of cultural community across the region
   - Marae temples (heiau in Hawaii, ahu in Rapa Nui)
   - Archaeological remains extending west to the Caroline Islands

2. MIGRATION AND THE SEA AS COMMUNICATION PLATFORM
   (Migración y el Mar como Plataforma de Comunicación)

   Content:
   - Pacific peoples view the sea as connection, not barrier
   - "Vasa" (Samoan word for ocean) derived from "va" meaning space or relationship between places, objects, and people (dynamic tension)
   - Radical difference in Pacific perspective vs. Western perspective
   - The sea as a medium of communication and travel
   - Knowledge and technology enabling this ocean relationship
   - Inter-island trade development (ancient and modern)
   - Deep understanding of sea travel challenges
   - Generational knowledge transfer during eastward migration
   - Natural social, cultural, and commercial exchange between Pacific islands
   - The ocean as a highway for the Polynesian community, not a geographic barrier

   Visual: Map showing migration routes and trade connections across Pacific islands


3. THE PACIFIC OCEAN (Scientific Context)
   (El Océano Pacífico)

   Key Facts:
   - Area: 165,700,000 km²
   - Largest body of water on Earth
   - Covers one-third of Earth's surface
   - Evolved from the Panthalassa Ocean
   - Formed 750 million years ago from Rodinia separation
   - Pacific Plate: first oceanic floor, formed 160 million years ago
   - Expansion center in western central Pacific
   - Largest oceanic plate on Earth
   - Current Nazca, Cocos, and Juan de Fuca (Gorda) plates initially united
   - North-South extent: ~15,000 km (Bering Sea to Antarctica)
   - East-West extent: ~19,800 km maximum width (Indonesia to Panama coast)

   Visual: Globe or 3D representation of the Pacific Ocean with tectonic plate information
